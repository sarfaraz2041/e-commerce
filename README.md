# e-commerce
This project is a simple e-commerce site built with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript, and Node.js. It displays 20 electronic products with images, prices, and “Add to Cart” buttons. Users can add items, view their cart, and see item counts. The backend (Express) manages cart data via API routes.
